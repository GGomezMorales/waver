<h1 align = "center">Waver Robot</h1>

### Overview

This repository contains a collection of ROS (Noetic) packages designed to be executed both in simulation and on a real robot, with a focus on the [Wave Rover](https://www.waveshare.com/wave-rover.htm) by [Waveshare](https://www.waveshare.com/) as the primary hardware platform. These packages include launch files, configuration files, and resources necessary for running the ROS nodes efficiently. As an open source project, encouraging contributions and replication.

### Motivation

This project aims to create a low-cost robotic platform that serves as a base for implementing and testing complex packages and algorithms. It's designed to be accessible to both hobbyists and professionals, providing a flexible and expandable system for a wide range of robotics applications.

### Key Features

- **Low-Cost Implementation:** The project is designed to be an affordable solution (< $300 USD), providing a foundation for implementing and testing complex packages and algorithms.

- **Extensive Documentation:** Each package includes documentation to help users understand and implement the provided features.

- **Cross-Platform Compatibility (Simulation):** The project supports Linux natively and Windows via Docker, specifically for simulation purposes. Efforts are ongoing to extend compatibility to macOS using Docker.
